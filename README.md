# DuckDuckGo Image Search API
Works with Python 3.7

Simple source code.

First request pulls a much needed token,
From 2nd request, we pull search results for free!
We have some basic logic, to retry the search engine in case it doesn't reply us with results.

You can run in the CLI with:
python -m duckduckgo_images_api Testing > out2.json
python -m duckduckgo_images_api Testing 20 > out2.json

If you would like to contribute changes, Feel free to do so!
